To set up TensorFlow GPU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnK1jO2kXOQ&t=0s [Without his tools.file]

Including the large 100s of MB drivers, this process takes around 15 minutes and is
by far the easiest way to install TensorFlow for GPU. The alternative is to download
many programs (3GB) to get the drivers and navigating many compatibility conflicts.

All steps below are entered in the Anaconda Prompt (search bar will bring it up).

-1) Get Anaconda
0) Open Anaconda Prompt.

1) conda install -y jupyter

2) conda create --name tf-gpu python=3.7 
 - Important: TensorFlow is not designed for 3.9 and GPU does not work for 3.8.
 - 'tf-gpu' can be any environment name, eg 'tf-gpu-env' or 'tf-env

3) conda activate tf-gpu
 - Use your chosen environment name instead if not 'tf-gpu'.

4) conda install nb_conda pandas matplotlib  tensorflow-datasets seaborn
- May need to add 'scipy' but should be covered.

5) conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu

6) conda install -c conda-forge keras-tuner tensorboard-plugin-wit

7) pip install wrds

8) python -m ipykernel install --user --name tensorflow --display-name "Python 3.7 (tf-gpu)"
 - Free choice over the display name in quotes, just to identify the environment
 - kernel in Jupyter selection.

9) jupyter notebook
 - Will launch brower, navigate to a .ipynb or click New>Python 3 in a suitable directory.

10) Click Kernel > Python 3.7 (tf-gpu) [The display name from step 9]

11) [In python script]
   ```import tensorflow as tf
      tf.config.list_physical_devices()```
- Check a GPU is listed. If so, we are done. If not, a mistake has been made.
